# EmarsysDueDateCalculator
Coding homework @ Emarsys

## About testing
- I have only written tests in Green Fox.
- I did my best. I even tried TDD.

## About the code
- I've used Builder pattern to avoid creating incomplite objects.
- Also included some exception to handle wrong inputs.

## About TODO's
I left some comment to remind me of 
- implementing a DI container,
- decouple BugFixBuilder from DefaultWorkTimeValidator,
- handle the lifetime of objects.
